TrackAnalysis is a photon process accounting program.  It runs as a 
'post-processing' step for RAT output files in ROOT format.  Essentially
it uses ROOTs object serialization tools to provide access to a class
called TrackedOpticalPhoton (described in TrackedOpticalPhoton.hpp) 
which stores the 'distilled' track information about the photons in the
simulation.  The compression in size is about an order of magnitude.

In order to use this package, you must:

	1) Compile it (obviously)
	2) Turn on trajectory storing in your RAT macros with
		/tracking/storeTrajectory 1

After that, you can use the program by running

	trackanalysis <input> <output>

You should be very careful about mixing up the order here, as 
trackanalysis currently opens output files as RECREATE - meaning
that if it already exists, it gets overwritten.  The implication is that
if you have an input file you want to process, and you accidentally give
it the name that you want it to output to, it will happily delete your
input file and then inform you that it's a little strange that you asked
it to process a file with no data in it.

Keep in mind that the output files can be enormous when track storage
is on!  50 3.2MeV electron events is approximately 1G.  The bright side
is that you will get ~2M photons as a result (50*3.2*11000 photons/MeV).

Further documentation is coming, but for now, I encourage you to read the
header files to find out what information you can get out of these tracks.
